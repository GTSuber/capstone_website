                            YASU’s current services are geared towards meeting individualized needs of members that are constantly changing. The impact that YASU has is then unbalanced across members due to this resource-intensive system. 
                            Members need specific types of support at specific times. The timing that they need this can always be changing based on the phase of their cancer journey. 
                            There are initial hurdles in engaging with YASU’s services that members must overcome before becoming more actively involved with YASU. These hurdles are: a lack of awareness of the resources available to them, and discomfort in self-advocacy.
                            Stephanie has been identifying the timing that members need support as well as helping members overcome initial hurdles. Because of the individualized nature of this work, she is only able to provide this for a certain number of members on her own. 
                            There is an opportunity for YASU to leverage this finding to maximize their impact and create more engagement from members by empowering them to support other members in the way Stephanie has been supporting them.

                            The initial phase of research was dedicated to enriching our team’s collective understanding of the problem space. This included gaining understanding of young adult cancer, non-profit organization management, and support-based communities. 
                            It is in this early research that we began to understand the challenges of being diagnosed with cancer during a stage of life where survivors are seeking to build relationships, careers, and families. Because people expect young adults to be healthy, survivors often have to advocate for themselves in the medical environment and while searching for emotional and financial resources. 
                            Members categorized the financial assistance application process as “easy” - and while that was by design - this grant processing required constant context switching and back and forth communication for the staff. We needed to understand how this workflow fit into the larger YASU strategy and operation.

                            “When I heard other people talk about the same similar things, to me, it made it more concrete that I was probably 
                            really experiencing it too. So it like helped me recognize that it's okay to bring up and talk about…”

                        <p>
                            Our next step was developing an understanding of the ins and outs of the organization. YASU offers two main services to 
                            its members: 1) Programs, including support groups, informational events, and social events, and 2) Grants, including the financial 
                            assistance grant and the Rae of Hope (ROH) grant. While continuing to build on foundational research with the clients - their goals, motivations, 
                            and tasks - we also connected with the YASU members to learn more about how they engaged with YASU’s staff, programs, and grants. 
                            As a service-oriented organization helping an underserved demographic, YASU operates on a high touch organizational model that is effective because the staff provides tailored support to its core members.

                            Finding #1 - YASU’s positive impact on the mental and emotional 
                            health of its members is not being measured in a systematic way.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finding #2 - Well-trained facilitators are crucial to ensure safety in support groups.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finding #3 - In order to meet the needs of the survivor and a non-profit organization,
                             each program or grant has its own nuanced process for applying, registering, attending, 
                             and communicating.

                        <p>
                            Finding #4 - New members often learn about YASU and its programs and grants through 
                            direct communication with Stephanie. Some need the extra encouragement to apply to take 
                            resources from the organization.
