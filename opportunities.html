                        <p>
                            At the start of our project, we were prompted with the challenge of streamlining YASU’s financial 
                            assistance system (or FAS), which means improving or simplifying the end to end process of a member 
                            applying for the FAS to the member receiving the grant, and all the steps in between. In the early 
                            stages of our research, we were able to better understand how the staff operates, what tools are in 
                            play, how the members engage in the system, and how workflows are interconnected. From there, we were 
                            able to understand and analyze the current “what is” state of YASU with regards to membership, grants, 
                            and programs. We then translated our data and findings to create a future “what could be” model that focuses 
                            on YASU scaling from a member, support, and operations perspective.

                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold">Membership</h5>
                        <p>
                            Currently, members find out about YASU and the services offered through Google search, which requires support though 
                            website management and email. This also creates a burden on YASU staff, as they have to use a variety of tools and 
                            resources to bring in new members and grow the organization using unsustainable processes.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Grants</h5>
                        <p>
                            Distributing grant funding through financial aid is a major feature among YASU’s services. However, the current state of 
                            this service requires a lot of backend work, and forces YASU staff to work inefficiently, stealing time away from growth strategies for the organization. 
                        </p>

                        <h5>Programs</h5>
                        <p>
                            YASU’s programs fall under four main categories, including support groups, social events, workshops/informational events, and forming connections. 
                            Each of these four areas has its own processes, yet there is still a large overlap For each area, members have to find, register, 
                            and then receive the information they need. When this occurs, YASU staff are required to operate a multitude of tools and handle a 
                            large amount of information to make sure the program is running smoothly.

                        <p>
                            Notice when members are looking for resources during intial diagnosis and registration, there is a misalignement among members and YASU staff.
                            This is primarily due to the need for YASU staff to readily distribute information to members. 
                        </p>

                              The Financial Assistance System proves to have many points of misalignment among members and YASU staff. There is an opportunity to offload staff effort, 
                              by exploring ways to establishing effective error prevention measures to the application process.

                          Attending workshops proves to be an desirable experience among YASU members. Interview participants have described the positive effect these 
                          programs have on their lives. Many of them have expressed that there was difficulty attending events due to their schedule or current health status. Currently, the misalignment between 
                          members and YASU staff involves the need to track impact and attendance of events. There is a valuable opportunity to explore ways for members 
                          to have greater planning and individualization of support groups, and YASU staff able to document the activity of their community.

                            Developing YASU’s organizational pillars with standardized processes, policies, and guidelines will ensure consistency 
                            across YASU’s services. Creating a systematic process to get feedback from members and track their engagement across 
                            services will allow YASU to evolve the organization based on member needs.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Empower member advocacy and peer support</h5>
                        <p>
                            Creating systems for volunteer work, both from YASU members and people outside the organization, will allow for support 
                            to travel to parts of the organization that weren’t engaged before. Member-to-member outreach and support will lower 
                            the initial hurdle of engagement for new members.

                    <p>
                        Creating efficient workflows will allow YASU staff to have more time to work on expanding services. Allowing for more 
                        transparency around the current status of these processes will also enable members to manage their own engagement.
                    </p>

                    <h5 style="font-weight:bold; color:#034C8C">Growing staff and funding</h5>
                    <p>
                        Clearly defining and delegating responsibilities to avoid overlap in workflows will enable YASU to hire more staff as they 
                        expand. There is also a stronger need for more facilitators for support groups, with qualification standards and training to ensure 
                        that support groups can continue to have high impact as YASU grows.
